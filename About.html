        My name is Busisile Zilwa, born and raised in Khayelitsha.
        I started school at Chumisa Primary School in 1997(grad1 - 9),
        my love for maths and problem skill ability was discover at that school.
        Principal Mr N.N Bongo(retired) directed my to a school of Mathematics, Science and Technology.
        A boding school in Constatia, i spend three years of my life in the school and i was in varies competitions.
        I participated on the Maths olympiad hosted The University of Cape Town in three consecutive years.
        Then there was a Civil Engineering competitions for Water distribution which i also participated for 2 consecutive years.
        I was among the first group to take part on the MTN Science competitions which I won a bronze medal for and my project was titled
        "Water Distribution". After High School i went straight to The University Of Cape Town to persue a degree in Mathematics, Statistics and Physical Statistics, majoring in mathematics.
        I spent a year, I guess I did not enjoy the studies. I moved to The University of The Western Cape to study BSc in Computer Science, this
        where i fell inlove with coding. However i did not manage to complete the degree, but my passion for coding never altered abit. I Then
        join CodeX to fulfill my coding dreams.
